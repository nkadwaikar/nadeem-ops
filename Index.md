# **🚀 Cloud Engineering — Built With Precision and Occasional Coffee Spills**

This site includes a few labs, small architectures, and notes I’ve created while working with Azure services.  
Everything is written in a simple, easy‑to‑follow way… even on days when the coffee machine is judging me.

## **👋 About Me**

I work with Azure services and enjoy putting together clear, practical notes that make cloud tasks easier to understand.  
I like keeping things organized and lightweight, so they’re easy to revisit later — especially when I forget how I did something the first time.
