# **🚀 Cloud Engineering — Built With Precision and Occasional Coffee Spills**

This site includes a few labs, small architectures, and notes I’ve created while working with Azure services.  
Everything is written in a simple, easy‑to‑follow way… even on days when the coffee machine is judging me.

## **👋 About Me**

I work with Azure services and enjoy putting together clear, practical notes that make cloud tasks easier to understand.  
I like keeping things organized and lightweight, so they’re easy to revisit later — especially when I forget how I did something the first time.

## **📘 Featured Labs**

### **Azure Front Door (Standard/Premium) — Static Website Lab**  
A small walkthrough of setting up Azure Front Door with a static site.  
It includes the usual steps, a few helpful checks, and the occasional “why is this not propagating yet” moment.

### **Azure Storage Static Website**  
A simple setup for hosting a static site in Azure Storage.  
Straightforward, lightweight, and great for those days when you want things to just work without surprises.

### **Azure CDN (Microsoft CDN) — Coming Soon**  
A short lab on using Microsoft’s CDN service.  
Still in progress, but it’s already teaching me new ways to appreciate caching… and patience.
