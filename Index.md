# 🚀 Cloud Engineering — Built With Precision (and the Occasional Coffee Spill)

Welcome to my Azure learning lab — a growing collection of hands‑on exercises, architectures, and Boot Camp notes.  
Everything here is written the way I like my cloud environments: **clean, predictable, and friendly enough that even a low‑caffeine version of me can follow it.**

This repo tracks my full **Azure Administrator Boot Camp (AZ‑104 Track)** — a structured, identity‑first journey through Azure’s core services.  
Each week focuses on a major domain (Identity, Networking, Compute, Monitoring), and every week ends with a real‑world capstone project deployed with Bicep.

If you're here for:
- repeatable labs  
- clear architecture patterns  
- practical troubleshooting  
- or just to see how much coffee one person can consume while learning Azure  

…you’re in the right place.
