# Day 5 — Full Identity + Governance Architecture Lab

## Chapters to Review
- Chapter 1
- Chapter 2
- Chapter 3
- Chapter 7

## Learning Objectives
- Combine identity, storage, and governance
- Build an end‑to‑end architecture
- Validate cross‑service interactions

## Lab Steps
1. Combine RBAC + Entra roles
2. Combine PIM + Access Reviews
3. Combine Storage + Private Endpoints
4. Combine Policy + Management Groups
5. Validate end‑to‑end flow
6. Create architecture diagram (Draw.io)

## Validation
- Identity → Storage access works
- PIM → Role activation works
- Policy → Compliance enforced
- Private Endpoint → DNS resolves privately
- Architecture diagram reflects all components

## Architecture Diagram
Add file: `diagram.png`  
Recommended sections:
- Identity (Entra ID, PIM, RBAC)
- VM + Managed Identity
- Storage + Private Endpoint + DNS
- Management Group + Policies
- End‑to‑end flow arrows

## Expected Outcome
A complete, portfolio‑ready identity + governance architecture.
