# ☕ Final Project — The Secure Customer Portal (Enterprise Edition)
Every great Boot Camp deserves a grand finale — and this one brings together everything from Weeks 1–8 into a **real‑world, enterprise‑grade challenge**.  
Think of it as the moment when all the coffee, late‑night debugging, and identity‑first discipline finally pay off.

This capstone mirrors how senior cloud engineers think in the real world:

- **Can I build it?** (AZ‑104)  
- **Can I protect it?** (AZ‑500)  
- **Is it the right way to build it?** (AZ‑305)  
- **Can I operate it in production?** (Landing Zone mindset)

It's not just a lab — it's a full journey from "hello world" to "hello enterprise."

## 🔧 Phase 1 — Build It (AZ‑104)

Start with the basics:

- Deploy an Azure App Service  
- Deploy an Azure SQL Database  
- Connect the app to the database  
- Validate everything works  

☕ *This is the warm‑up coffee — the first sip before the real work begins.*

---

## 🔐 Phase 2 — Secure It (AZ‑500)

Now the caffeine kicks in. You harden the environment using Zero Trust principles:

- Remove SQL public access  
- Add a Private Endpoint  
- Enable VNet Integration for App Service  
- Move secrets into Key Vault  
- Use Managed Identity for secretless authentication  
- Add a WAF (Front Door or App Gateway)  
- Trigger and investigate a Defender for Cloud alert  

☕ *This is the "double‑shot espresso" phase — strong, sharp, and security‑focused.*

---

## 🧠 Phase 3 — Architect It (AZ‑305)

Shift from engineer to architect:

- Add SQL Auto‑Failover Groups  
- Deploy a secondary region  
- Use Azure Front Door for global routing  
- Evaluate DTU vs vCore  
- Add Redis Cache for performance  
- Make cost vs performance trade‑offs  

☕ *This is the "slow‑pour artisan brew" — thoughtful, strategic, and full of design decisions.*

---

## 🛠️ Phase 4 — Operate It (Platform Engineering)

Finally, make it production‑ready:

- Centralized logging (Log Analytics)  
- Application Insights  
- SQL Insights  
- Diagnostic settings for all services  
- Alerts (CPU, DTU, 500 errors, failover events)  
- Azure Policy enforcement  
- Optional CI/CD with Bicep + GitHub Actions  

☕ *This is the "keep‑the‑team‑running" pot of coffee — operational excellence in a mug.*

## 🏁 What You End Up With

A fully functional, enterprise‑grade platform:

- Secure  
- Resilient  
- Globally distributed  
- Cost‑optimized  
- Monitored  
- Governed  
- Automated
