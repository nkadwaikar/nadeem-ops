# 🚀 Cloud Engineering — Built With Precision (and the Occasional Coffee Spill ☕)

A growing collection of Azure labs, architectures, and Boot Camp notes — written to stay clean, practical, and easy to revisit.  
Built for the days when the cloud behaves, and the days when it needs a little extra coffee (or encouragement).

This repository is designed for cloud engineers, architects, and certification candidates who want **hands-on, production-style Azure labs** — not just theory or exam notes.

## 👋 About Me

I work across identity, networking, compute, automation, and cloud security — and I enjoy turning complex Azure scenarios into clear, repeatable, real-world implementations.

My goal is simple:  
Documentation that's lightweight, structured, and friendly enough that *future me* doesn't have to reverse-engineer my own work — whether it's a Monday morning or a late-night coffee session.

## 🎓 Azure Boot Camp — Identity-First, Architect-Ready, Security-Focused

This repository tracks my full **Azure Boot Camp**, built around real-world cloud engineering and aligned with:

- **AZ-104** (Administrator)  
- **AZ-305** (Architect)  
- **AZ-500** (Security Engineer)  

Each week focuses on a major Azure domain and ends with a **capstone project** that demonstrates architect-level thinking and hands-on capability.

Every lab is designed to be:

- Clear  
- Repeatable  
- Production-aligned  
- Identity-first  
- Backed by Bicep deployments  

All written with the same care I put into my coffee — precise, consistent, and energizing enough to keep learning fun.

## 🧪 How to Use This Repository

You can use this repo in two ways:

### **1. Follow the Boot Camp**
Start at Week 1 and progress through the labs and capstone projects.

### **2. Use it as a Reference**
Jump directly to specific services, architectures, or labs.

Each lab includes:

- Prerequisites  
- Step-by-step deployment  
- Validation and troubleshooting  
- Architecture context  
- Cleanup guidance  

> ☕ Pro tip: Keep a cup of coffee nearby — some labs are best enjoyed with caffeine and curiosity.
