# 👋 Hi, I’m Nadeem — Cloud Engineer & Azure Architect in the Making

I design and build cloud systems that are **identity‑first**, **network‑secure**, and **production‑ready**.  
My work spans Azure identity, networking, automation, governance, and security — with a focus on turning complex cloud patterns into clean, repeatable, real‑world implementations.

I love building things that future‑me won’t have to reverse‑engineer.  
And yes, most of it is powered by ☕.

# 💡 What I’m Great At

- Designing identity‑first, enterprise‑grade Azure architectures  
- Turning complex cloud patterns into clean, repeatable labs  
- Building secure network baselines (Hub‑Spoke, Zero Trust, Private Link)  
- Automating deployments with Bicep + GitHub Actions  
- Writing documentation that feels human, not corporate

# 🚀 What I’m Building Right Now

### **Azure Boot Camp — 8 Weeks of Hands‑On, Architect‑Level Cloud Engineering**

A full, end‑to‑end Azure learning journey designed around:

- Real enterprise architectures  
- Identity‑first security  
- Networking fundamentals + advanced routing  
- Automation + monitoring  
- Landing zone patterns  
- Capstone projects every week  

Each week includes:

- 7 hands‑on labs  
- 1 capstone project  
- Architecture diagrams  
- Validation steps  
- Bicep deployments  
- Exam alignment (AZ‑104, AZ‑305, AZ‑500, AZ‑700)

# 🧩 How I Work

- I document everything so future‑me never suffers  
- I design architectures that scale cleanly  
- I automate anything I repeat twice  
- I validate every lab like it’s production  
- I treat clarity as a feature, not an afterthought  

---

# ☕ Fun Facts

- I break down cloud problems the same way I make coffee: slowly, carefully, and with a little joy  
- I believe documentation is a love letter to your future self  
- I think architecture diagrams should be as clean as the systems they represent
